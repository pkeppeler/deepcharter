/**
 * Prepares the Node-side render runtime on first use.
 *
 * The render engine (`./engine`) runs under Node because Bun cannot load Dawn's `dawn.node`, and it
 * needs three packages the rest of the headless server does not: `three`, `three-blockbench` and
 * Dawn. They are declared in `headless/package.json` and installed into a per-user cache folder the
 * first time a render is requested, so the plugin's own `node_modules` (and an `npx` install of it)
 * stay small. The engine source is then bundled with `Bun.build` into one `cli.mjs` beside them,
 * because Node refuses to strip types from files under `node_modules` (where `npx` unpacks this
 * package).
 *
 * The install runs `npm install`, which resolves the manifest's version ranges. Once a
 * `package-lock.json` is committed beside the manifest, it is copied too and installed with
 * `npm ci`, which pins every package; none is committed yet, so nothing is pinned.
 *
 * Layout of the cache folder (`home`):
 * - `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `node_modules/`: the installed dependencies
 * - `cli.mjs`: the bundled engine
 * - `.install` / `.build`: content hashes that decide when to reinstall or rebuild
 * - `.lock/`: a directory taken while installing, so parallel agents do not corrupt each other
 *

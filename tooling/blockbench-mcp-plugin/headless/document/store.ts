/**
 * File access for the headless server: path sandboxing, revisions, locking and
 * atomic writes.
 *
 * Several agents can work at once because each one runs its own headless
 * process, or shares one process through several MCP sessions. Three guards keep
 * their edits from clobbering each other:
 *
 * - A lock file (`<model>.bbmodel.lock`, created with O_EXCL) serializes
 *   read-modify-write cycles across processes. Inside one process a promise
 *   chain does the same without touching the disk. A lock older than 30 s is
 *   taken over as abandoned, so the lock file holds an owner token: right before
 *   renaming, a writer checks that it still owns its lock, refreshes it, and
 *   checks that the file is unchanged since its read. A writer whose lock was
 *   taken over (an edit that blocked for longer) then writes nothing, instead of
 *   overwriting the new owner's work. The takeover itself is not atomic, so this
 *   narrows the window for a lost write rather than closing it.
 * - Every read returns a `revision` (a hash of the file bytes). Write tools accept
 *   `expected_revision` and refuse to write when the file changed since the
 *   caller read it, so an agent never overwrites work it has not seen.
 * - Writes go to a temporary file first and are renamed into place, so a crash or
 *   a concurrent reader never sees a half-written model.
 *
 * The sandbox compares real paths (symlinks and junctions resolved), so a link
 * inside a root cannot lead outside it. A link whose target is missing has no
 * real path and is refused.
 *

/**
 * Bytecode Index Service
 *
 * Provides authoritative per-class bytecode metadata for a remapped Minecraft
 * JAR, backed by the bundled ASM bytecode-dumper. This is the ground truth the
 * Access Transformer validator runs against.
 *
 * WHY BYTECODE (not decompiled `.java`): decompiled source OMITS compiler-
 * generated members — a record's canonical constructor and its component
 * accessors (`value()`, `name()`, …) never appear in VineFlower output. Parsing
 * source therefore reports those implicit members as "not found", producing
 * false positives (issue #12). The bytecode has every member with its true
 * access flags and erased descriptors — exactly what an AT is applied to at
 * load time (and exactly what `javap` shows). Validating against the JAR is the
 * single, consistent source of truth.
 *
 * CACHING: the remapped JAR (`remapped/{version}-{mapping}.jar`) is a
 * deterministic byproduct of decompilation and never changes for a given
 * (version, mapping) — so metadata derived from it is inherently fresh. We keep
 * a small, incremental, on-disk cache next to the JAR
 * (`{version}-{mapping}.bytecode.json`) that grows as classes are requested. The
 * cache stores the JAR's size+mtime signature; if the JAR is rebuilt (e.g.
 * `decompile_minecraft_version --force`) the signature changes and the cache is
 * discarded automatically. Only the handful of classes an AT actually targets
 * are ever dumped — never the whole ~15k-class JAR.

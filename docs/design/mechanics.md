## Cicatrium pacing (issue 209)

**Problem.** The Prospector restore costs $1,500 and 3 Cicatrium. The money takes about 4 layer 2 runs (PR 206). Cicatrium sits only in Shift Change (0.02% per block) and Prospector's Run (0.06%), so a deepest-zone run finds about 0.06 and 3 take about 50 runs. SPEC section 7 puts the Prospector at the end of onboarding, for every charter.

**The advance.** The Company advances each charter the first 3 Cicatrium of its Prospector, against its contract. The hangar restore spends the advance for whatever the pack lacks (the pack's Cicatrium goes first). It is spent once per charter, recorded per charter in the hangar's saved data. It is never put in the pack, so it cannot be sold. The console says so in one line. It fits the lore: the Company pays bonuses and issues advances, and a debt "against your contract" is how it keeps hands.

**Why not the others.**
- A guaranteed source in the world (ore in a wreck bay): it exists once per world, so only the first charter gets it. Every charter has its own onboarding.
- Tuning the ore rate: 3 in 4 runs needs about 0.0077 per block, 13 times the deepest zone's rate, which makes Cicatrium ($1,500) the best ore to sell.
- Lowering the restore's cost: it makes the catalyst a trinket.

**Selling.** There is nothing to sell: the advance is consumed by the restore. The ore's $1,500 value and its catalyst role are unchanged. A test caps what a run's Cicatrium may be worth against its other income.

**Knobs.** `HangarTuning.RestoreCost.advance` (3, next to `catalysts`; a test requires advance >= catalysts for the Prospector). The money price. The ore chances in `fill_shift_change.json` and `fill_prospectors_run.json`.

**Open questions.**
- Should a later chassis restore (the Badger) carry an advance too, or is Cicatrium from the ore the intended wait there?
- Should an unspent advance lapse if a charter restores a Mole wreck first? Today it does not: only the Prospector has one.
